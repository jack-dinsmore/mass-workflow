# MASS workflow presentation

* **workflow.key** is the Keynote file for my slides. **workflow.pdf** is the same but as a PDF
* **latex** contains my code for copying figures from elsewhere on a computer to one directory, so I can sync them to Overleaf
* **matplotlib** contains my matplotlib stylefile as an example of the defaults you can change.
